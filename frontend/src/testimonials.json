My daughter is vegetarian so I love how they have options my whole family can enjoy. My favorite thing to get their is the ube roll cake, it's super fluffy and it has a great ube flavor.",

It was very crowded, so I think the workers just lost track of time or something. Their pan de sal was probably the best piece of bread I had ever eaten, though. I'm totally coming back for that, but I wish they sold it by the dozen",
